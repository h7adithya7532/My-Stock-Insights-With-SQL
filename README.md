# My-Stock-Insights-With-SQL

# üìà Stock Portfolio Analyzer


A SQL Server-based data analytics project that provides insights into stock investments using ROI (Return on Investment), total profits/losses, and investment patterns. This project is built using real transaction-level portfolio data and is designed to showcase analytical skills using SQL.\

üß† Project Objectives

- Analyze stock-wise performance based on ROI
- Identify which stocks generated the most profit or loss
- Determine where the highest investments were made
- Present insights that can help in smarter investment decisions

üèóÔ∏è Project Setup (SQL Server 2022 Express)

1. Create Database

CREATE DATABASE StockAnalyticsDB;
USE StockAnalyticsDB;

2. Import Excel/CSV to SQL Server

* Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* Right-click `StockAnalyticsDB` ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Import Flat File
* Select your `.csv` file and complete the wizard

3. Verify Table

SELECT* 
FROM importstockdata;


üìä Key SQL Queries

1. üîÅ Total Investment and PnL Per Stock


SELECT stock_name,
       SUM(CAST(buy_value AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Invested,
       SUM(CAST(realized_pnl AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Realized_PnL
FROM importstockdata
GROUP BY stock_name
ORDER BY Total_Invested DESC;


### 2. üìà ROI (Return on Investment) Per Stock

```sql
SELECT stock_name,
       CAST(SUM(CAST(realized_pnl AS FLOAT)) / NULLIF(SUM(CAST(buy_value AS FLOAT)), 0) * 100 AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS ROI_Percentage
FROM importstockdata
GROUP BY stock_name
ORDER BY ROI_Percentage DESC;
```

---

### 3. üìâ Loss-Making Stocks

```sql
SELECT stock_name,
       SUM(CAST(realized_pnl AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Loss
FROM importstockdata
GROUP BY stock_name
HAVING SUM(CAST(realized_pnl AS FLOAT)) < 0
ORDER BY Total_Loss ASC;
```

---

### 4. üìÖ Monthly Performance Overview

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(CAST(trade_date AS DATE), 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
       SUM(CAST(realized_pnl AS FLOAT)) AS Monthly_Profit
FROM importstockdata
GROUP BY FORMAT(CAST(trade_date AS DATE), 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month;
```

## üîç Insights Extracted

* **Top Performing Stocks**: Based on highest ROI
* **Most Invested Stocks**: Where the largest capital was allocated
* **Profit vs. Loss Distribution**: Easy to see loss-making vs. profitable stocks
* **Monthly Trends**: Investment performance over time

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

* Add Power BI Dashboard to visualize KPIs
* Use Python (Pandas + Matplotlib/Seaborn) for more advanced analysis
* Add live stock price integration via API
* Automate daily PnL updates using SQL Jobs or ETL
